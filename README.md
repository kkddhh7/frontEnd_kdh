# frontEnd
2024 예술적인 소프트웨어 디자인 개발 (FrontEnd Page)입니다.

## Git Branch 전략
- 작업하기 전, 자신이 작업할 브랜치 파놓고 시작할것 (브랜치 이름 'b1'이라 하면 'main/b1'으로 브랜치 생성'
- 큰 기능이나 페이지 개발이 끝나면 PR올리고 병합할 것. (merge하기전에 나머지 2명에게 확인받은 후 merge)
    -> 한 브랜치 파놓고 계속 작업하다 큰 작업물을 merge할 경우 다른 브랜치랑 merge할때 충돌이 너무 많이 생기니까 중간중간 꼭 해주셈.
    -> pr올렸는데 충돌나면 뭐 없앨지 다같이 회의하고 작업하는 거로.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
